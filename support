,"type":"commonjs"  used for import

Now how to solve this issue? We can solve this using these 3 easy steps...

Step 1: First, you have to need to open the command prompt and run this command.
set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser 

When you run this command, you can see that your system has set all policies for the current user as remote. It will take a few seconds to complete this process.

Step 2: Now you have to run the second command on your system. This command is:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

When you run this command, your system shows “RemoteSigned.” If you receive this message, your problem will be solved. Now, you have to go to the next step to view the list of policies updated by the last commands.

Step 3: To view their policy, you need to run this command in your command prompt:
Get-ExecutionPolicy -list
